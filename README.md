#### range.js
* Simulates pythons range function. Will output an Array of numbers based on the arguments passed into it.

#### game.js
* Runs a game of black jack. Each player (player vs computer)
  is dealt cards from a deck of 52 shuffled cards. The player can
  choose to be dealt more cards or stop being dealt cards. The
  sum of the numeric value of the cards in a player's hand determines if
  they have won.
* Hands are compared after the player and computer finishes. A hand
  worth over 21 is a bust. Else, the player with the hand closest to 21 wins.
  Ties are possible.

#### cardUtils.js
* Contains functions that are used in game.js which runs a game of black jack!

#### linkedList.js
* Objects, as generic blobs of values, can be used to build all sorts of data
  structures. A common data structure is the list (not to be confused with
  the array). A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding
  a reference to the second, the second to the third, and so on.
* This program implements that data structure and contains an prepend
  function to add a new element to the front and a nth function to
  find an element recursively in a list.
